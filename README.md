## Assignment 1

>A car part belongs to one factory, though there can be many of each part. For each part, keep track of the name and
the number of parts that are available. For this assignment, we won't be adding or subtracting from the number of parts
available.
A factory has a location and has many parts.
Cars have make and model names, VIN numbers, and have many parts through a factory.
In the form for a car, have a drop-down with a list of possible parts to be added.
